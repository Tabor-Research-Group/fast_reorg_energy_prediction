# Fast Reorganization Energy Predictions achieved by Robust Graph Neural Network against Conformers

This repository includes:
* Curated QM9 dataset with their vertical IP, vertical EA, reorganization energy in `./data`
* Code for tranining and evaluating the Modified [ChIRo](https://github.com/keiradams/ChIRo) model in `./ChIRo`
* Code for tranining and evaluating the SchNet implemented with [SchNetPack](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack) in `./SchNet`
